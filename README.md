## Google Colab
If you do not have a laptop with a GPU, you can use Google Colab instead. To do so, use this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ewjCNOSGN-woJjBJ61e9cg6lxd9eCdQ0?usp=sharing) to connect to the notebook as a viewer. From here you can copy it to your own space.

To use the GPU select it under the settings for runtype.
